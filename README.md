# Freshroast SR700 Artisan Server

Server to use the Freshroast SR700 with Artisan (https://artisan-scope.org/). This server simplifies dramatically the setup and the configuration of Artisan (settings are included).

It also allows to fully automate the roasting with users' profiles that can be easily created with another tool (see the end of the document).

If available the Phidget Temperature Sensor can be used to improve the roasting and to measure the true beans temperature.

This work was inspired by the SR700-Artisan-PDServer (https://github.com/infinigrove/SR700-Artisan-PDServer) and freshroastsr700(https://github.com/Roastero/freshroastsr700/tree/master/freshroastsr700).

## 0. Requirements

Python >=2.7

You can use the Python installed with your system, but I strongly suggest to install and use the Anaconda or Miniconda Python 3.7 freely available from here:

http://anaconda.com/download

On Windows machine unfortunately you have to use speficially Python 3.5  and change the PATH variable

Open the Anaconda Prompt (not the powershell or window cmd!), a terminal will show up.

In the terminal window type:

`conda create -n artisan python=3.5 -y`

## 1. Phidget setup (OPTIONAL)

If you have a Phidget temperature sensor, install the Phidget driver for your machine: https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Operating_System_Support

## 2. Install this Server with:

First make sure you are using the correct env with:

`conda activate artisan`

### OSX or Linux:

Open a terminal or the Terminal app (osx) and type this command:

`pip install SR700_Artisan_Server`

To update from an old version type:

`pip install SR700_Artisan_Server==1.7`

### Windows:

On a Window machine the procedure is slightly different.

Open the Anaconda Prompt and activate the environment you have created before with:

`activate artisan`

Then install the Server with:

`pip install SR700_Artisan_Server`

Check where you have the scripts with:

`where Start_SR700_Artisan_Server`

This will show where the path of the server and the other scripts, in my machine this returns:

`C:\Users\Luca\Miniconda3\envs\artisan\Scripts\Start_SR700_Artisan_Server.exe`

Add the first part to your PATH variable i.e.:

`C:\Users\Luca\Miniconda3\envs\artisan\Scripts`

If you don't know how to do that, check this illustrated guide: 
https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/

Close the window.


*Important* If you are updating the server from an old version (<1.6) please download again and reload the setting file!

## 3. Start the server in the Terminal with:

`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server`  

If you a a Phidget without an hub, start the server with:

`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension phidget_simple`

If you a a Phidget with the hub, start the server with:

`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension phidget_hub`

Depending on your hub setup you may need to change hub port and channel adding these two flags:

  ```
  --phidget_hub_port PHIDGET_HUB_PORT
  --phidget_hub_channel PHIDGET_HUB_CHANNEL
  ```

For example, to use the hub port 0 and the channel 1:

`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension phidget_hub --phidget_hub_port 0  --phidget_hub_channel 1`

If the server is running correctly you should see something like this if you have a Phidget:
```
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
```
Or like this without a Phidget:

```
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150  Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150  Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150  Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150  Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
```
If you use a MAX31865, then start the server with:
`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension max31865`

You should see something like this with the MAX31865:
```
[ [State:idle](Temp SR700:150)(Temp max31865 119)(Target temp: 449)(Fan Speed: 9)(Time left: 649) ]
```

If you need to, you can also specify the GPIO pins used by the MAX31865, e.g.
`Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension max31865 --max_31865_gpio_cs=8 --max_31865_gpio_miso=9 --max_31865_gpio_mosi=10 --max_31865_gpio_clk=11`


#### NEW! you can also enable the Artisan PID mode adding the flag:

```
 --pid_mode artisan
```


This can be combined with all the options above. For example to use the internal temperature prove the command is:

```
Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --pid_mode artisan
```

To use the phidget with 1 channell instead:

```
 Start_SR700_Artisan_Server --enable_extension phidget_simple --pid_mode artisan
```

** NOTE**  To use this new function you need to download and load the new setting file available below.


See documentation for `freshroastsr700_phidget` for more info.

## 4. Start Artisan

**Important** if you are on a Mac start Artisan **from the Terminal app** with these commands:

First make sure you are using the correct env with:

`conda activate artisan`

Then run:

`/Applications/Artisan.app/Contents/MacOS/Artisan`

## 5. In Artisan go under Help and select Load Settingsâ€¦

If you want to use the internal PID download and use this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucapinello/SR700_Artisan_Server/master/SR700_Artisan_Server/settings/artisan-settings.aset

In this case the roasting profiles are created through alarms and a generic profile is already loaded. To create custom profiiles you need to use this software: https://github.com/lucapinello/SR700_Artisan_Profile_Builder


### NEW! If you want to use the Artisan PID and its excellent designer, use instead this file:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucapinello/SR700_Artisan_Server/master/SR700_Artisan_Server/settings/artisan-settings_sr700.aset

Here you can read how to use the artisan designer:

https://artisan-scope.org/docs/designer/

The fan control is not supported in the Artisan designer so you need to add alarms yuorself

Now you are ready to roast!

Hit Start, and keep in mind that the first 30sec are for preheating the machine.


# Remote Execution

It is now possible to run the Server on a different machine than Artisan itself; see REMOTE_EXECUTION.md for more details.
